## # Project Abstract

+ OpenCV is an open-source library developed mainly for real-time computer vision operations such as object detection, object tracking, etc. Currently, OpenCV supports trained models with benchmarked results on various datasets via its model_zoo. However, it only supports a limited number of models.

> <i> The aim of this project is to add object detection models such as YOLOv5, EfficientDet, etc. to the list of existing models in the OpenCV model zoo  in order to produce source code related Metrics </i>
